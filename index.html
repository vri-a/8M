                        The French Revolution (1789) and the Enlightenment marked a major change. The ideas of equality and freedom, although initially directed at men, served as the basis for the first female demands. The first struggles focused mainly on access to education, the right to work and to property. <strong>Mary Wollstonecraft, with her "Vindication of the Rights of Woman" (1792),</strong>  was a key figure in this period.

                        The main focus shifted to the right to vote. Figures such as <strong>Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the United States, and Emmeline Pankhurst in Britain,</strong> led often radical and challenging campaigns.<br>
                        Significant advances in women's suffrage were made in different countries throughout the 20th century, although the timing and process varied considerably.

                        The range of demands expanded to include equal pay, access to contraception and abortion, the fight against gender violence and discrimination in the workplace and in the family. <strong>Simone de Beauvoir ("The Second Sex") and Betty Friedan ("The Feminine Mystique")</strong> were key figures.<br>
                        Legal advances were made in many countries, although often with strong social and political resistance. The feminist movement became more visible and articulate, influencing culture and politics.

                        The aim is to increase the inclusion, representation and visibility of women of different races, social classes, sexual orientations and gender identities.<br>     
                        There has been greater recognition of the complexity of women's experiences and new political agendas have been promoted, such as the fight against domestic violence and sexual harassment.

                        The fight for equal pay continues, as does the pursuit of greater political representation and representation in all areas of society. Important debates are taking place on issues such as gender-based violence (femicide, harassment), reproductive rights, equality in education and access to healthcare, the fight against sexism and misogyny in culture and the media. New forms of online and offline activism are constantly emerging.

            <p class="note">*The evolution of women's rights is a complex and multifaceted story, marked by significant advances but also by persistent inequalities. It's not a straight upward line, but a process with ups and downs, progress and setbacks, varying considerably depending on geographical region and sociocultural context. Here we analyze the main stages.</p>
